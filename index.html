  The Importance of Movies
  </h1>
<p>
  Movies are a popular form of entertainment for people around the world. Reading books, however, is also a form of entertainment
  that many people enjoy. While both play a critical role in the formation of our culture, I find that movies impact people in a
  different way than books do. Movies provide viewers with a different perspective and give a physical representation of the story.
  Movies also take innovation and creativity to make the story come alive for audiences. Because of these reasons, I feel that
  movies play an integral role in the development of our culture.
