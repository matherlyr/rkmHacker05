<h1>
The Essentials of Software Engineering
</h1>
  <br />
<p>
  As Maria once said the <i> The Sound of Music,</i> "Let's start at the very beginning, a very good place to start" <br />
  A very good start in order to become a software engineer is learning basic technical skills. A programming <br />
  language, for instance, provides an engineer with a starting point for learning the ins and outs of creating and using the <br />
  code behind websites. In her video, however, Mayuko tells us that anyone can be a successful software engineer. So, it doesnâ€™t<br />
  matter who you are or where you come from if you want to be a ðŸ˜Šsoftware engineer. As Mayuko gained more experience in this <br />
  field, though, she realized that there are certain qualities that software engineers have in common:
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>First, Mayuko says that software engineers are much more collaborative than many people think. There is a large amount <br />
    of time spent talking to users to make sure that all their needs are met through the work of the software engineer. Also, <br />
    software engineers must collaborate in order to determine the best and most concise way to present something on the internet.<br />
    This quality of collaboration is reflected in our syllabus for this class through the fact that we are paired with a <br />
    classmate to do all projects and assignments. This allows both partners to learn while also allowing partners to learn <br />
    from one another to accomplish a goal.
    </li>
  <li>Another point Mayuko makes in the video is that soft skills become more important for software engineers than technical <br />
    skills. She states that because a majority of the job is being collaborative, soft skills are important so that work can <br />
    be accomplished and done in a professional way. This is displayed in our syllabus because we our encouraged to talk to other <br />
    about the prep-work and reading that is due the night before class.
  </li>
  <li>Mayuko makes an additional point to say that software engineers are empathetic. More specifically, <br />
    software engineers use empathy when collaborating with one another. The example Mayuko uses is that when collaborating <br />
    with others, software engineers make sure their code is readable and others can easily understand what is going on in<br />
    their code. This is reflected in our syllabus by the fact that when we provide help to one of our classmates, the classmate <br />
    shows appreciation of the help by documenting their name as a resource. 
  </li>
  </ul>
